    <h1>Porotta Recipe</h1>
    <p>Parathas are one of the most popular and loved accompaniments in the Indian flatbread scene. And just like any other curry, lentil or rice-based dish with many variations to it, even the world of parathas has distinct recipes, from region to region.This recipe of Malabar Paratha results in a soft, flaky and crispy layered flatbread. Making these is a time-consuming process, but worth investing your energy and efforts in making them. </p>

    <h2>How to make Porotta</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><p>Traditional Parotta recipe is made using maida, salt, sugar and oil. Eggs are used to keep the dough very soft, but since we wanted to make the parotta recipe without eggs, we used milk and water to knead the dough.</p></li>
        <li><p>The dough kneading is slightly different from the usual methods and as much as kneading is important, the dough has to rest well to yield soft, flaky and layered parottas.</p></li>
        <li><p>While making balls of dough  called beeda, the dough is pushed inside between thumb and index finger, that way producing the smoothest ball.

         <li><p>Authentic parotta is made by throwing & swinging the dough around instead of rolling it, to make it as thin as possible. For home cooks with limited bench space, this could be a challenge. So we used an easier approach of spreading the dough as thin as possible, donâ€™t mind the holes but just get the dough wafer thin.</p></li>
        <li><p>The spread dough is folded in a long ribbon that in turn is rolled into a rough circle. It is important to handle the dough as gently as possible.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>And most importantly, press the prepared parotta using your fingers instead of rolling them to retain all the layers.</p></li>
        <li><p>Cook the parotta on medium flame with enough oil, this helps it keep softer for longer duration.</p></li>
        <li><p>Stack all the prepared parottas and press them on both sides to bring out the layers!</p></li>
        <li><p>And <strong>Chai Sutta </strong>to finish</p></li>
